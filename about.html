                        <p>Hi there, I’m Cameron and I’m a self-taught photographer currently attending Algonquin College for media design. A little history about me: Media design and photography was not what I originally thought I would be going to school for. Out of high school I was very interested in computer programming and the opportunities that were to be had in that field, so I applied to Algonquin for Computer Engineering Technology and that’s what I took for 2 years. It was during that second year that I realized that coding was not something that I wanted to be doing for the rest of my life, and that is when I found photography. I had a friend’s Canon T3 at the time just to see what it was like, so I started teaching myself the basic fundamentals of photography in my spare time and loved every second of it. If I wasn’t at school or work, I would either be taking pictures experimenting to see what worked and what didn’t or would be online researching anything photo-related that I could find. When should I be shooting wide open? What shutter speed should I use for this type of shot? Why is good glass so freaking expensive? It was all very fascinating to me. It wasn’t soon after that I bought myself my first real camera (I had owned cameras before this point, but they were nothing to write home about) and I applied for a transfer to Interactive Media Design at Algonquin College. And that brings us to today, a couple years later and still loving what I do.</p>
